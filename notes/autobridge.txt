- autobridge rate (quality) never changes
- autobridge currency is XRP
- created rate and quantity may not be the same as create offer rate and quantity
- Response must have two OEs each one against XRP
- Real rate = both of OEs' rates multiplied
- Real quantity = look at OE's non-XRP quantity
- OEs have different accounts than ours
- OEs' PreviousTxnID are not the same as OC's hash
- Ignore OC's with other's account. It might consume our order. 
- If order is not fully matched then autobridge tx will produce extra tx to sell or buy bridge currency (XRP).
